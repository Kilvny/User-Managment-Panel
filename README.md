# Project Description
I tried to make the code clear as possible, self described and easy to read and follow along for anyone who'd like to learn, apply on or improve this app and reuse it
This is a web app I built to apply concepts learned on how to create a server side app, how to make *requests* and get *responses* and *create well maintainable API's*

- The main Idea:
The app is connected to mongoDB database on Atlas on the cloud 
It's like an admin panel for a website/clinc/orginzation, etc..

- How to use the app: 
You can create a user and store it's information in the database
You can update the list of user's, update a single user info, or delete the user data record from the mongoDB

# Technologies\libraries\conceptes worked with and covered :
- NodeJS/Express
- Mongoose/MongoDB on the cloud
- NPM
- EJS
- AJax
- jQuery
- Axios
- MVC project structer
- CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
